Course Name: Data Mining Social Science

Aim of the Course

Data mining, especially for social science data, is rapidly evolving and gaining popularity. Nowadays, societies produce a lot of written information through news, social media, policy, and legal documents. 

Text data is the future of data science and analytics. Academics and research agencies use data mining to measure data, detect patterns and trends in real-time, understand text sentiments, uncover crucial insights, and construct prediction models. Furthermore, predictive models and data classification help solve economic, financial, and political issues. 

Especially in the Middle East and Africa studies, research data is also scarce and difficult to gather. Data mining can be a welcome rain in such areas. This lecture introduces numerical representations of text data. To demonstrate how these tools can solve economic, financial, and political issues. 
Within the lecture, there will be a workshop. Students will learn to create computer programmes to analyse real-world data, from raw text to understanding and visualising the finished data using R. This lecture will take the entire data mining and analysis process. 

The course will use Quanteda, an online library for textual data analysis. Students will learn text analysis in R and use their skills in diverse real-world case studies. 
This technical training uses R coding. Algebra and calculus knowledge are recommended but not required. It also helps to know a functional or object-oriented programming language. Use "R" for lectures, class activities, and assignments but do not know how to speak or write. 

The course will cover popular text data collection, processing, and analysis methods. Approaches are supervised and unsupervised. 
The training will cover topics such as: 

- Web scraping methods use
- Text cleaning and preprocessing 
- Dictionary methods 
- Machine learning approaches
- Topic modelling
- Scaling with applied statistics


Week 1: Data mining and social science overview and introduction
The lecture uses this session to hear about studentsâ€™ interests, experiences, and data mining and R programming discussions.

- Introducing course structure and requirements
- Qualitative data analysis in a digital world
- Quantitative data analysis in a digital world

Week 2: Hello World and Computational Social Science
Computational social science is the subfield of social science that focuses on computational approaches. Social phenomena are being modelled, simulated, and analysed by computers. This section gives an overview of the rest of the course's ideas in computer science and R.

- Data as Qualitative and Quantitative
- What is computational social science?
- An introduction to R and RStudio and the most common commands and functions.
- Hello World
- Arithmetic Operations, Objects, Vectors, Functions, Data Files, Saving Objects and Packages
- Programming and Exercises


Week3: Research Designing Social Science
For example, studies in the social sciences focus on methodological reflections on empirical research as well as conceptual integration of chosen methodologies.

- Methodological process
- Research questions
- Source Data: Selection and Procurement
- Preprocessing Preparations
- Analysis
 

Week 4: The Basics and Practice (Causality)
Examples of data mining that can be used in the social sciences in Africa and Middle Eastern fields is

- Logical values and operations and simple conditional statements with factors
- Causal effects and the counterfactual
- Descriptive statistics
- Exercises

Week 5: The Basics and Practice (Measurement)
Examples of data mining that can be used in the social sciences in Africa and Middle Eastern fields is

- Handling Missing Data
- Visualization
- Correlation
- Exercises


Week 6: Web Page Data Scraping

- How do we get online data from news media and social media?
- Learning how to scrape or crawl via using the R package 'rvest', scraping (websites and tables), and using loops and functions


Week 7: Text mining fundamentals
Text manipulation in R, Quanteda grammar basics, and frequency tests

- What is data mining in a practical sense?
- Narrative Analysis
- Metaphor Analysis


Week 8: Social Science Text Mining in Practice
Text manipulation in R with the following: 

- Thematic Analysis
- Relationship between words and text.
- Text analysis
- Simple visualisation (frequency and word cloud)


Week 9: Common data mining visualisations
Advanced text manipulation in R, word clouds, co-occurrence networks, sentiment analysis, word score, and wordfish.

- Co-occurrence network
- Sentiment analysis
- Word score and wordfish


Week 10: Topic model
Topics Concerning Structure

- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- The Correlated Topic Model
- Topics Concerning Structure


Weekly 11: Spatial data
Geographic data is introduced as a third type of information, alongside texts and networks. Maps are the best way to analyse spatial data. 

- Spatial point data can be displayed on a map as a collection of points.
- Spatial polygon data is a group of connected points on a map that show the borders of places like counties, districts, and provinces.
